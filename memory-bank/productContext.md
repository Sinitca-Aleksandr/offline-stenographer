# Video Transcription GUI - Product Context

## Problem Statement
Creating accurate transcripts from video content is essential for accessibility, content repurposing, and information retrieval. However, existing solutions are either:
- **Too complex**: Professional transcription services requiring extensive setup
- **Too limited**: Basic tools without speaker diarization
- **Not user-friendly**: Command-line only interfaces
- **Cloud-dependent**: Requiring internet connection and data upload

## Solution Overview
A simple, desktop-based GUI application that brings professional-grade transcription capabilities to end users through:
- **Local processing** with Docker containers for privacy and reliability
- **Speaker diarization** to identify different speakers in the audio
- **Multiple export formats** for different use cases
- **Real-time progress** feedback for long video processing

## User Journey
1. **File Selection**: User drags/drops or browses to select video file
2. **Format Choice**: User selects desired output format (txt/md/docx)
3. **Processing**: Application extracts audio and processes with WhisperX
4. **Progress Monitoring**: User sees real-time progress updates
5. **Export**: Transcript is saved in chosen format with speaker identification

## Key Differentiators
- **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally via Docker
- **No Internet Required**: Works offline once Docker image is available
