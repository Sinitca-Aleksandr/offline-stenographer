# Video Transcription GUI Application - Project Brief

## Core Requirements
A desktop GUI application for creating transcripts from video files using WhisperX (Docker) backend for transcription and diarization.

## Project Scope
- **Input**: Video files (mp4, avi, and other common formats)
- **Processing**: WhisperX Docker container for transcription and speaker diarization
- **Output**: Multiple format support (txt, md, docx)
- **Interface**: Tkinter-based GUI with progress display
- **Language**: Python 3

## Primary Goals
1. **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple GUI for selecting video files and export options
2. **Robust Processing**: Reliable video transcription using WhisperX Docker backend
3. **Progress Feedback**: Real-time progress updates during transcription process
4. **Multiple Formats**: Support for plain text, Markdown, and Microsoft Word exports
5. **Format Flexibility**: Handle various video formats without requiring manual conversion

## Success Criteria
- Application successfully transcribes video files with speaker identification
- GUI provides clear progress feedback during processing
- Output files are properly formatted and readable
- Docker integration works reliably across different environments
- Application handles errors gracefully with informative messages

## Non-Goals
- Real-time transcription (file-based processing only)
- Advanced video editing features
- Cloud-based processing (local Docker only)
- Multi-language GUI (English only)
- Mobile or web versions

## Target Users
- Content creators needing video transcripts
- Journalists and researchers
- Meeting recording transcription
- Accessibility support for video content
- Educational content transcription

## Technical Constraints
- Must use Docker for WhisperX backend
- Tkinter for GUI (cross-platform compatibility)
- Local processing only (no cloud dependencies)
- Support for common video formats without external dependencies
